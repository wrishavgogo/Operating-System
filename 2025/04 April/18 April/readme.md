Difference between internal and external fragmentation 


Internal Fragmentation :-  You have more than you need , you have enough space and the process is small for the fixed size block 
                            mostly happens in fixed fragmentation 
External Fragmentation :-  You have enough space but cannot allocate memory because space is not contiguous , 
                            This happens mainly when compaction/defragmentation has not taken place and you dont have enough space to allocate the process
                            at the moment
